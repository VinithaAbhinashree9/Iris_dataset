# Iris_dataset
This project performs exploratory data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Iris Dataset Analysis using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the famous Iris dataset using Python.
The goal is to understand the dataset through data exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Project Steps:

Importing necessary libraries

Loading the Iris dataset

Understanding the dataset structure

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Creating visualizations (pairplots, histograms, scatter plots)

Observing patterns between features and species

Key Insights:

Setosa species is easily separable from the other two species.

Petal length and petal width are strong indicators for classification.

There is some overlap between Versicolor and Virginica.
